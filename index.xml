Unlike in Istanbul, you don’t really come across big stationery stores here. If you’re looking for something more specific, Amazon is pretty much the only option.</p>
<p>I think the most popular and easiest-to-find pencils in Edinburgh are the Staedtler series.</p>
<p>I’ve had a few of them and have been using them daily for at least five months now. Honestly, I’m surprised by the performance of the HB pencils from Staedtler. Typically, HB pencils aren’t my favorite because they’re harder to write with and not as bold as 2B pencils. But Staedtler does a good job—the writing feels comfortable, and the darkness is almost just right.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>A Tea Shop in Edinburgh</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/rosevear-tea/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 16:54:40 +0800</pubDate><author>merturk</author><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/rosevear-tea/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I am more of a tea person than a coffee person. I can&rsquo;t give up my daily tea habit, which I enjoy from breakfast to night. In the UK, there is a wide variety of tea flavors available. Recently, I discovered a teashop in Edinburgh called <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cP2kLBxuwJkcFYwY7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Rosevear Tea</a>. To try their offerings, I purchased Bruntsfield Breakfast Tea. While the taste was ok, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly what I was looking for. I will be exploring alternative flavors in the coming days.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Stirling Castle</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/stirling-castle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 17:04:40 +0800</pubDate><author>merturk</author><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/stirling-castle/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Stirling Castle is one of Scotland&rsquo;s iconic castles, offering a spectacular view of the Stirling area. Built in the 1500s, the castle has played a significant role throughout <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/stirling-castle/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">history</a>.</p>
<p>It served as a royal residence during that time and is easily accessible from Edinburgh. With attractions such as the Royal Palace, the Great Hall, and beautiful gardens, it is definitely worth a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/merturk/albums/72177720327359544/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">visit</a>.</p>

During my visit to the National Museum of Scotland, I encountered the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jacquard loom&lt;/a>,  invented by French weaver Joseph-Marie Jacquard in 1804. I learned that this production of patterned textiles was automated using punch cards, demonstrating their use as far back as the 1800s. I was surprised to find out about this historical application of punch cards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matlab R2025a Features a New User Interface</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/matlab-2025a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:46:40 +0800</pubDate><author>merturk</author><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/matlab-2025a/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I have been using MATLAB for a long time and was quite happy until switching to the first Apple Silicon M1. Matlab&rsquo;s full adoption took way longer than I expected. Finally, the R2025a version starts fast, runs fast on Apple Sicions (I only tested M4 Max), and is less laggy.</p>
<p>I think the transition from Java is completed since no Java version is detected on the version.</p>

<p>bench(3) returns incredible results (below). I hope Matlab will support it natively on other platforms that use Arm CPUs.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Simple RSA Encryption with Mathematica</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/rsa-example/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 18:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>merturk</author><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/rsa-example/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>RSA is a widely used public-key algorithm that relies on a pair of keys — a public key (e) for encryption and a private key (d) for decryption.

In this era, where almost everything is connected to the internet, objects are getting smarter. Despite being surrounded by gadgets that measure our body stats like steps, heartbeats, and sleep patterns, I still prefer the traditional method of using paper and pencil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To capture meeting notes, initial thoughts, designs, daily/weekly logs, and improvements, I prefer using paper and a pen (mechanical pencil or even a fountain pen). The pen remains an active part of my daily workflow. Although I have tried working with an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil 2, I could not get the efficiency I wanted, as it never feels like a pen. The only downside of using paper and pencil is that you can’t access them from anywhere and must carry your notes around. However, the most significant advantage of this traditional method is that you can work away from noise and distractions. When things get their shape on paper, they are transferred into the digital world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Everyday Fountain Pen Ink</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/f-ink/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 12:16:40 +0800</pubDate><author>merturk</author><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/f-ink/</guid><description>&lt;p>I continue to stay analog in the digital world, mainly using pen and paper. Besides pencils, I also like to use fountain pens (as well as other types of roller pens). I have tried many inks so far, and Parker Blue-Black QUINK Ink ( &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Parker-Quink-57ml-Bottle-Permanent/dp/B000J61TIM?th=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Amazon Link&lt;/a>) is the best in terms of color, smoothness, and price tag. The deep, rich tone of blue-black provides an elegance that enhances my writing, making even the most everyday notes and draft ideas special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Reflections on Reading</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/my-reflect%C4%B1ons-on-reading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>merturk</author><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/my-reflect%C4%B1ons-on-reading/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I started to share scientific papers related to my interests that could be informative, mostly on digital twins, IoT, 5G/6G networks, and cybersecurity. Except for scientific content (papers, book chapters, reviews, etc.), I plan my reading each year and try to stick to the plan to hit my annual goals. This year, I barely achieved half of the books I planned to read the previous year.</p>
<p>I recently read a book titled The Art of Laziness: Overcome Procrastination &amp; Improve Your Productivity. The book is concise and has a suitable length, discussing its points with just the right amount of content — neither too much nor too little. Here are my main takeaways from the book: First is Cyril Northcote Parkinson’s Law, which states that “work expands to fill the time available for its completion.” This means that the amount of work we’ll do tends to increase to fill the time we give ourselves. Another key point is that “all you need are two things: a pen and paper.” I still find it effective to use a pen or pencil and paper to jot down my thoughts. This method works well for me, and I plan to continue using it. Lastly, I want to mention the Pygmalion Effect, which is a psychological phenomenon where you tend to work harder when you see yourself as a diligent person.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
