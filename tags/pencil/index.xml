Unlike in Istanbul, you don’t really come across big stationery stores here. If you’re looking for something more specific, Amazon is pretty much the only option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the most popular and easiest-to-find pencils in Edinburgh are the Staedtler series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve had a few of them and have been using them daily for at least five months now. Honestly, I’m surprised by the performance of the HB pencils from Staedtler. Typically, HB pencils aren’t my favorite because they’re harder to write with and not as bold as 2B pencils. But Staedtler does a good job—the writing feels comfortable, and the darkness is almost just right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pencil</title><link>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/pencil-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 20:46:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://mehmetalierturk.com/posts/pencil-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a long time, I’ve wanted to write about something that fascinates me — pencil. In this era, where almost everything is connected to the internet, objects are getting smarter. Despite being surrounded by gadgets that measure our body stats like steps, heartbeats, and sleep patterns, I still prefer the traditional method of using paper and pencil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To capture meeting notes, initial thoughts, designs, daily/weekly logs, and improvements, I prefer using paper and a pen (mechanical pencil or even a fountain pen). The pen remains an active part of my daily workflow. Although I have tried working with an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil 2, I could not get the efficiency I wanted, as it never feels like a pen. The only downside of using paper and pencil is that you can’t access them from anywhere and must carry your notes around. However, the most significant advantage of this traditional method is that you can work away from noise and distractions. When things get their shape on paper, they are transferred into the digital world.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
