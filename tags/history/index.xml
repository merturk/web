Built in the 1500s, the castle has played a significant role throughout &lt;a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/stirling-castle/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">history&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It served as a royal residence during that time and is easily accessible from Edinburgh. With attractions such as the Royal Palace, the Great Hall, and beautiful gardens, it is definitely worth a &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/merturk/albums/72177720327359544/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">visit&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

During my visit to the National Museum of Scotland, I encountered the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Jacquard loom&lt;/a>, invented by French weaver Joseph-Marie Jacquard in 1804. I learned that this production of patterned textiles was automated using punch cards, demonstrating their use as far back as the 1800s. I was surprised to find out about this historical application of punch cards.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
